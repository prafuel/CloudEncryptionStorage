# ☁️ Cloud Encryption Storage

🚀 project is designed to provide a secure,user-friendly, and versatile platform for storing files on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This project involves encrypting user files using unique encryption keys, securely uploading them to GCP, generating file IDs for easy retrieval, and providing options for encryption and decryption.

📝 just created as my Cloud Project for my college, more improvement will be done by time, <br>
☑️ using file id : update,delete,insert file on GCP (Google Cloud Provide)
